Deleting every message of a translation file now persists. If all messages of a locale (or of an i18next namespace of a locale) were deleted, the export had nothing to write for that file, so `saveProjectToDirectory` left it on disk as it was, and the deleted messages came back on the next load.

The plugin contract of `exportFiles` with `files` is extended: a plugin also returns a file for every previous file that the project read, that holds messages the project no longer has and that the export doesn't otherwise write, without those messages. Whether the project read a file is the new `ExistingFile.imported`: `saveProjectToDirectory` sets it for files whose content is what `loadProjectFromDirectory` imported or what a save wrote. A file the project never read (e.g. of a locale added to the settings after loading, or changed on disk since) is never emptied; hosts that can't tell leave `imported` out. `keepUnchangedJsonEntries` does this for the JSON plugins (message-format, i18next, json, next-intl, icu1, apple-xcstrings): every key that imports to a message is removed (walking into objects that hold messages), everything else (`$schema`, keys the plugin doesn't read) and the formatting stay, so a file whose messages were all deleted becomes `{}`, or `{ "$schema": … }`. The file is kept, not deleted: the plugin still lists it for the locale, the next message of the locale goes there, and tools may expect it. The previous file's `path` is the exported file's `name` and its `metadata.pathPattern`, so `saveProjectToDirectory` writes it to exactly that file, also one of a `pathPattern` array; other hosts that pass `files` should write a file with a `metadata.pathPattern` there too. Files that hold no deleted message (e.g. an empty file, or an i18next namespace whose messages another namespace overrides) stay byte-identical.

`@inlang/plugin-apple-strings` writes the `.strings` file of such a locale without its entries and their comments; other comments (e.g. a license header) stay. `@inlang/plugin-android` writes the `strings.xml` of such a locale without its messages; elements it doesn't import (non-translatable strings, `<string-array>`s, …) and heading comments stay.
